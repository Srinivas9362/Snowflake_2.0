MASTER PROMPT FOR FULL LEARNING MODULES (Zero → Advanced)

I am learning Data Engineering, and I want a complete, structured learning guide for the topic: [INSERT TOPIC NAME].

Please explain it in a Day-wise deep-dive format just like a professional trainer would do — from zero to advanced, including concepts, diagrams, FAQs, syntax, examples, mini-projects, admin commands, and best practices.

Your response should include the following sections in order:

🧩 Concept Overview:

Clear explanation of what the topic is and why it’s important in Snowflake/Data Engineering.

Real-world context (where it is used and why).

🗺️ Visual Diagram:

Simple text or image diagram that shows how the concept fits in the Snowflake / Data Engineering architecture (like Database → Schema → Table → etc).

💡 Deep Technical Explanation:

Cover from beginner to expert level.

Include all subtopics (logical structure, purpose, use cases, cost implications, governance/security, limits, and retention concepts).

Explain related features (like cloning, time travel, undrop, fail-safe, ownership, etc., if applicable).

🧾 SQL / Python Syntax Section:

Provide all important commands and syntaxes with examples.

Cover basic, intermediate, and advanced use cases.

Include DDL, DML, and admin commands (CREATE, ALTER, SHOW, GRANT, CLONE, DROP, UNDROP, etc.).

🧠 Interview + Real-World Questions:

List at least 10 practical and interview-level questions an Advanced Data Engineer should know on this topic.

Provide short, clear answers or best-practice guidance.

🧰 Troubleshooting & Admin Commands:

Include common errors, their causes, and how to verify/fix them.

Mention how to check metadata or logs (using INFORMATION_SCHEMA or ACCOUNT_USAGE views).

⚙️ Mini Projects / Hands-on Exercises:

Provide 2–3 small step-by-step mini-projects I can try in Snowflake or locally using Python/Airflow/NiFi.

Each should simulate a realistic scenario (like creating DBs and cloning, or loading data via COPY INTO).

💰 Cost, Performance & Security Notes:

Explain how this feature or operation affects storage/compute cost, performance, and access control.

📋 Summary Checklist / Cheat Sheet:

Provide a “ready-to-copy” list of key SQL commands, syntax patterns, and best practices.

🧩 References (optional):

If available, mention relevant Snowflake documentation links or real-world references for further reading.

Extra instructions:

Keep the explanations friendly, step-by-step, and practical.

Focus on Snowflake but include parallels to generic data engineering systems where useful.

For visuals, use either text diagrams or Markdown flowcharts.

For each concept, mention how to check, verify, or monitor using INFORMATION_SCHEMA or ACCOUNT_USAGE.

At the end, summarize everything as a Day plan (e.g., “Day 1 covers X topics, estimated time: 3 hours”).

Example input:
If I say — “Explain Databases, Schemas, and Tables in Snowflake” — then you should return a full detailed breakdown like a Day-1 training guide including: concepts, diagrams, SQL syntax, FAQs, mini projects, cost notes, troubleshooting, and a final summary.

Now generate the guide for: [INSERT YOUR TOPIC HERE]

💬 Example usage:

You can copy this entire prompt and use it like:

“Use the master prompt. Generate the guide for: Day 1 — Databases, Schemas, Tables, and Data Loading in Snowflake.”

Or:

“Use the master prompt. Generate the guide for: Day 2 — Snowflake File Formats, Stages, and COPY INTO in depth.”

okay I am ready to start witht the day01
Day 1	Databases, Schemas, Tables basics, Data Loading Concepts	🟢 Beginner	🟩 4 topics	Understand Snowflake storage hierarchy, logical vs physical data organization.

can you please give the pricture and explain with the all topics in this day 1 and with syntaxes from zero to advance, 

suppose If I consider the Dataabses, 
why, we create it , where, how, what is the use , 
time travel, clone , cost of it , where to check it from , like information schema, how many tables are created, transerownereship of it, drop and undrop, rename, hierarchy, and many other question,
frames all the questions by your own on each topis which are more necessay for a advance data engineer, 
and pease provide the syntax and examples, and at last after each one can you please create a mini project so that I can under stand it in the better way.

to get all these details write a promt that, if I give this promt it should understnad in details and give as per my requirmentes
